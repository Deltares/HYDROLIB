# Developments
DHyDAMO now has the functionality to build a full 1D-2D-RR-RTC model based on HyDAMO DAMO2.2 data. Not all components are yet fully coupled to Hydrolib-core. If hydrolib-core evolves, DHyDAMO will be updated to include more and more hydrolib-core functionality.

On the short term, we are working to provide in installation package for DHyDAMO, which will be consistent with other Hydrolib-modules.
