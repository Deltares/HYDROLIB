# HydroMT-Delft3D FM: Delft3D FM plugin for HydroMT
**The HydroMT-Delft3D FM plugin is under development!**

## What is the HydroMT-Delft3D FM plugin?
This plugin provides an implementation of the HydroMT model API for the [Delft3D FM Suite 1D2D](https://www.deltares.nl/nl/software/d-hydro-suite-1d2d/) model.

[HydroMT](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/) is an open-source Python package that facilitates the process of
building and analyzing spatial geoscientific models with a focus on water system models.
It does so by automating the workflow to go from raw data to a complete model instance which
is ready to run and to analyze model results once the simulation has finished. 

## Why HydroMT-Delft3D FM?
*Work-in-progress*

## How to use HydroMT-Delft3D FM?
The HydroMT-Delft3D FM plugin can be used as a **command line** application, which provides commands to *build*,
*update* and *clip* a Delft3D FM model with a single line, or **from python** to exploit its rich interface.
