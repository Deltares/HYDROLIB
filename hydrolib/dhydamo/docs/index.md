# DHyDAMO
**DHyDAMO is still under development!**

## What is DHyDAMO?
DHyDAMO provides tools for automatic generation of  [Delft3D FM Suite 1D2D](https://www.deltares.nl/nl/software/d-hydro-suite-1d2d/) models based on [HyDAMO DAMO2.2](https://hkvconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DHYD/pages/222396421/Achtergrond) data.

[DHyDAMO](https://github.com/Deltares/HYDROLIB/tree/main/hydrolib/dhydamo) is an open-source Python package within the Hydrolib environment that enables automatic generation of [D-Hydro](https://www.deltares.nl/nl/software/d-hydro-suite-1d2d/) models  based on a [HyDAMO DAMO2.2](https://hkvconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DHYD/pages/222396421/Achtergrond) dataset.

## Why DHyDAMO?
DHyDAMO offers more functionality and flexibility than its predecessor [delft3dfmpy](https://github.com/openearth/delft3dfmpy). Moreover, coupling to the Hydrolib-core functionality ensures that the interface to D-Hydro remains up to date.

## How to use DHyDAMO?
The DHyDAMO functionality is usable through a JuPyteR notebook. An example is provided in the [tutorial](getting_started/installation_guide.md).
