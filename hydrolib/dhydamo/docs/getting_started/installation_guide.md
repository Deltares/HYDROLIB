# Installation Guide
*work-in-progress*

There is no consistent installation package yet for DHyDAMO. This is in progress. If you are interested in the code, have a look at [the Github page](https://github.com/Deltares/HYDROLIB).

Or, install the package [delft3dfmpy](https://github.com/openearth/delft3dfmpy). It offers similar (except for RTC) functionality and will eventually be deprecated if DHyDAMO becomes fully available.
