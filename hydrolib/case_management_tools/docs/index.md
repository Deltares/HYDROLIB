## Installation

We recommend to build your environment using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). You can build an environment Ã¡nd install CMT by conda in one go using this <a href="https://github.com/Deltares/HYDROLIB/blob/main/hydrolib/case_management_tools/envs/environment.yml" target="_blank">environment.yml</a> from the command-line:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After creating your environment you can activate it with:
```
conda activate hydrolib
```

In that activated environment you can add cmt with pip in the setup.py directory:
```
pip install .
```

## Get started

The repository contains a self-explanatory [Jupyter Notebook](/../notebooks/stochasten_workflow.ipynb) (in Dutch). You can open it in an activated environment in the notebooks directory by:

```
jupyter notebook stochasten_workflow.ipynb
```
