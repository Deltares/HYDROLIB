# HydroMT-Delft3D FM: Delft3D FM plugin for HydroMT

## What is the HydroMT-Delft3D FM plugin?
[HydroMT](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/) is an open-source Python package that facilitates the process of
building and analyzing spatial geoscientific models with a focus on water system models.
It does so by automating the workflow to go from raw data to a complete model instance which
is ready to run and to analyze model results once the simulation has finished. 
This plugin provides an implementation of the model API for the [Delft3D FM Suite 1D2D](https://www.deltares.nl/nl/software/d-hydro-suite-1d2d/) model.
