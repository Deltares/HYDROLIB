    "As a user I would like to query the (max)-values of a limited amount of locations (< 1000) for hydrological variables as water level and discharge. I know the node-ids, later probably x and y coordinates of these locations. A developper can expect models to contain as many nodes as DHYDRO can compute (e.g. 1E10^6) and dense timeseries (e.g. 1000 timesteps per simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested two approaches for reading a DHYDRO NetCDF file:\n",
    "1. Using Deltares UGrid: https://github.com/Deltares/UGridpy\n",
    "2. Using NeCDF4: https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "For every approach I show the info I can get from each module:\n",
    "* UGrid gives me a flat (1D) array of a multi-dimensional variable.\n",
    "* NetCDF gives me the \"metadata\" of the variable; the variable is lazy-loaded. This metadata contains handy info (e.g. dimension variables) I can use to slice and transform the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I checked the size and performance. As I can only read the entire array in memory UGrid more time and memory to load 1 variable. For this simple model (653 nodes, 145 timesteps) I do not run into a wall. But be aware, my model with 1E10^6 nodes and 1000 timesteps will consume 8GB of memory for loading 1 variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "netCDF4 also outperforms UGridpy in terms of user-friendlyness. As shown below I can see the dimension-variables (time and mesh1d_nNodes) I can use to conveniently slice the data and only load what I need."
